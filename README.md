# OAStack
A Python manager for COOP providing oriented, asymmetric stacking techniques.

Clone the respository via:

git clone https://github.com/cbevington/OAStack

then run setup.py to organize input/output directory structure. OAStack.py can then be run in the command line. The program is a menu-like interface which allows one to select the stacking parameters before they are sent to COOP. The finished stack is stored as a PDF with a logfile of the same name.

At the present time, many options in the code have TODO flags. Make sure you have the latest version.
