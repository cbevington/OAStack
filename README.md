# OAStack
A Python manager for COOP providing oriented, asymmetric stacking techniques.

Pull the respository into COOP, then run setup.py to organize input/output directory structure. OAStack.py can then be run in the command line. The program is a menu-like interface which allows one to select the stacking parameters before they are sent to COOP. The finished stack is stored as a PDF with a logfile of the same name.
